# SimGAN_PyTorch
A Simple Pytorch Implementation of Apple's [Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07828)

This code is based on [AlexHex7/SimGAN_pytorch](https://github.com/AlexHex7/SimGAN_pytorch)(PyTorch) and inspired by [wayaai/SimGAN](https://github.com/wayaai/SimGAN)(Keras&Tensorflow).

I try to re-organize AlexHex7's code, fix some bugs and speed up the training procedure.
